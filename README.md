This repository is for my infrastructures.

## Kubernetes
I have deprecated the Kubernetes deployments I used because it was getting slightly too pricey. You can read about how it was done in [the k8s directory](./k8s/README.md)

## Virtual Machines
The main way I do this now is using Terraform with Digital Ocean.
